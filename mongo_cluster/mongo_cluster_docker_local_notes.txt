Set up (local) mongo cluster using Docker

----------------------------------------

Start by creating a network (when running locally, i.e. on a single docker machine)
docker network create mongonetwork

----------------------------------------

Network stuff

Create docker user defined network to allow containers to talk to each other (bridge network (single host) by default):
docker network create mongonetwork

Connect containers we have created already to the network:
NOTE: Can also specify a network using the --network flag in the docker run command when creating the containers

docker network connect mongonetwork configserver-mongo
docker network connect mongonetwork shard1-mongo

Can inspect the network, see that the containers were added and what their IP addresses are
docker network inspect mongonetwork

----------------------------------------

Config server:

Start config server container:
This command creates and starts mongo container, then runs the mongod command setting it up as a config server under the replica set "myReplicaSet"
(Note: Need to start the container (i.e. the mongo service in the container) as a config server from the get go, can't start a normal container and then specify it as a config server)
(Note: The mongod service will listen to connections on 27019 when running in config server mode (not the default 27017) by default. Make it use 27017 instead)

docker run --name configserver-mongo -p 32900:27017 --network mongonetwork -d mongo mongod --configsvr --port 27017 --replSet configServerReplicaSet

Open a shell into the container:
Could also do this from somewhere else (my machine), by connecting to port 32900.

docker exec -it configserver-mongo /bin/bash

Open a mongo shell (specifying a port strictly not necessary since 27017 is the default)
mongo --port 27017

Initiate replica set:
(Note: We only have one config server in the replica set)
(Note: The IP address in the members has to be the real IP address (or the container name), can see the IP address with network inspect)

rs.initiate({ _id: "configServerReplicaSet", configsvr: true, members: [ { _id : 0, host : "configserver-mongo:27017" } ] })

Can do rs.status() to check the status of the replica set and find the primary (should be this node since there is only one member in the set):

rs.status()

----------------------------------------

Shard servers:

Start shard server container:
(Note: The shard server is listening for connections on 27018 by default (when running mongod in shard server mode), we make it use 27017)
docker run --name shard1-mongo -p 32901:27017 --network mongonetwork -d mongo mongod --shardsvr --port 27017 --replSet shard1ReplicaSet

Open a shell into the container:
Could also do this from somewhere else (my machine), by connecting to port 32901.

docker exec -it shard1-mongo /bin/bash

Open a mongo shell (specifying a port strictly not necessary since 27017 is the default)
mongo --port 27017

Initiate replica set:
(Note: We only have one shard server in the replica set)
(Note: The IP address in the members has to be the real IP address (or the container name), can see the IP address with network inspect)

rs.initiate({ _id : "shard1ReplicaSet", members: [ { _id : 0, host : "shard1-mongo:27017" } ]})

rs.status()

Connect to the primary
(should already be connected to it since there is only one primary)

And for the next shard server, and so on ...

docker run --name shard2-mongo -p 32903:27017 --network mongonetwork -d mongo mongod --shardsvr --port 27017 --replSet shard2ReplicaSet
docker exec -it shard2-mongo /bin/bash
mongo --port 27017
rs.initiate({ _id : "shard2ReplicaSet", members: [ { _id : 0, host : "shard2-mongo:27017" } ]})
rs.status()

----------------------------------------

mongos server:

Start mongos server container, and run mongos on it, pointing it to the config server
Also have to link it to the user defined network to allow it to talk to the config server
Find the IP address of the config server using docker network inspect, or just use the container name

docker run --name mongosserver-mongo -p 32902:27017 --network mongonetwork -d mongo mongos --configdb configServerReplicaSet/configserver-mongo:27017

Connect a mongo shell to the mongos server:
(Can do that from the server itself or somewhere else)
docker exec -it mongosserver-mongo /bin/bash
mongo --port 27017

Add shards to the cluster:
Do this for all shards, until the cluster includes all shards
sh.addShard("shard1ReplicaSet/shard1-mongo:27017")
sh.addShard("shard2ReplicaSet/shard2-mongo:27017")

Enable sharding for the database:
sh.enableSharding("some-db")

Shard a collection:

Here we shard the rankings collection by the pageRank key, using ranged sharding in (I think) ascending order.
(Note: When running this the collection gets created. Can't drop the collection when importing data from files).
sh.shardCollection("some-db.rankings", { "pageRank" : 1 } )

Here we shard the collection using hashed sharding on pageRank:
sh.shardCollection("some-db.rankings", { "pageRank" : "hashed" } )

Here we shard the collection using hashed sharding on the document IDs:
sh.shardCollection("some-db.rankings", { "_id" : "hashed" } )
